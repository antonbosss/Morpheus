- Morpheus Distribution Contract: [0x47176B2Af9885dC6C4575d4eFd63895f7Aaa4790](https://etherscan.io/address/0x47176B2Af9885dC6C4575d4eFd63895f7Aaa4790)

## How to deposit stETH into the contract?
We need to go to the [stETH](https://etherscan.io/address/0xae7ab96520de3a18e5e111b5eaab095312d7fe84#writeProxyContract) contract, open the “Contract” tab, then the “Write as Proxy” tab. Don't forget to connect your wallet, which should have enough native token to pay for gas.

Before contributing, we need to give the distribution contract an "approval" to transfer our stETH tokens. It is necessary to select the `approve()` function that will add allowance for Distribution contract. As parameters:
- `spender`: Distribution contract address - `0x47176B2Af9885dC6C4575d4eFd63895f7Aaa4790`
- `amount`: amount of tokens in WEI. Should be more or equal to the deposited amount. You can use this unit converter calculator https://eth-converter.com to help you.

Click “Write” and confirm a transaction.

Then, we need to go to the [Distribution](https://etherscan.io/address/0x47176B2Af9885dC6C4575d4eFd63895f7Aaa4790#writeProxyContract) contract, open the “Contract” tab, then the “Write as Proxy” tab. Don't forget to connect your wallet, which should have enough native token to pay for gas.
